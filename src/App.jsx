// 1. **Multiverse Tic-Tac-Toe:** Add more dimensions to the classic 3x3 grid. How about a 4x4 or 5x5 grid? It adds complexity and requires new strategies.
// 2. **Power-Ups:** Introduce power-ups like an extra turn, blocking an opponent's move, or clearing a spot. Players can earn these by completing mini-tasks or challenges.
// 3. **Themed Boards:** Create themed boards based on movies, seasons, or holidays. Imagine playing on a Halloween-themed board with pumpkins and ghosts!
// 4. **Time Attack:** Set a timer for each move. Players must think and act quickly, adding a layer of excitement.
// 5. **Mystery Boxes:** Place mystery boxes on the grid. When a player chooses a box, it reveals a surpriseâ€”an extra move, a penalty, or a fun fact.
// 6. **Team Play:** Instead of 1v1, create a team-based version where players take turns within their team. This encourages collaboration and team strategy.
// 7. **Hidden Moves:** Keep some moves hidden from the opponent until a certain number of turns have passed. This adds an element of surprise and unpredictability.
// 8. **Random Obstacles:** Add random obstacles on the grid that both players must navigate around. This can make the game more challenging and fun.
